When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When using a computer that does not have a workstation setup in advance such as a public computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes even after multiple commits, a change is not fully completed and ready for the remote version to be updated.
