When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When using a computer that does not have a workstation setup in advance such as a public computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes even after multiple commits, a change is not fully completed and ready for the remote version to be updated.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones created on GitHub that are used to create another version of an existing repository.
Clones are copies of repositories either from a GitHub fork or a local repositoy.
Branches are a sub-version of a repository in either local or remote. Used to separate feature(s) in a repository containing multiple commits such as a new game feature or difficulty level.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Don't have to deal with manually editing the file if there are conflict changes that aren't auto.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be less steps involved without using GitHub but harder to work on projects with multiple people or devices.
